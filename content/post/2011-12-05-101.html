<p>Hmm, the personal <a href="https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed">PlusFeed instance</a> that pumps my G+ posts into Twitter has broken down somehow. Maybe it's time to wrap up the <a href="http://labs.eweek.com/archives/in-the-lab-taming-tweets-with-talend-open-studio-5">G+ to Twitter via Talend project</a> I've been fiddling with. It's currently stalled at, "once I get things set up just right..."</p>
