<blockquote>RDO, the community-oriented OpenStack distribution for CentOS, Fedora, and their kin, is super-easy to get up and running, as a recently posted YouTube video illustrates:</p>
<p>At the end of the process, you'll have a single-node RDO installation on which you can create VM instances and conduct various experimentation. You can even associate your VMs with floating IP addresses, which connect these instances to the "Public" network that's auto-configured by the installer.</p>
<p>BUT, that's where things stop being super-easy, and start being super-confusing. The auto-configured Public network I just mentioned will only allow you to access your VMs from the single RDO machine hosting those VMs. RDO's installer knows nothing about your specific network environment, so coming up with a more useful single-node OpenStack installation takes some more configuration. </p></blockquote>
