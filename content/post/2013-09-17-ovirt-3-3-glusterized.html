<blockquote>The All-in-One install I detailed in Up and Running with oVirt 3.3 includes everything you need to run virtual machines and get a feel for what oVirt can do, but the downside of the local storage domain type is that it limits you to that single All in One (AIO) node.</p>
<p>You can shift your AIO install to a shared storage configuration to invite additional nodes to the party, and oVirt has supported the usual shared storage suspects such as NFS and iSCSI since the beginning.</p>
<p>New in oVirt 3.3, however, is a storage domain type for GlusterFS that takes advantage of Gluster’s new libgfapi feature to boost performance compared to FUSE or NFS-based methods of accessing Gluster storage with oVirt.</p>
<p>With a GlusterFS data center in oVirt, you can distribute your storage resources right alongside your compute resources. As a new feature, GlusterFS domain support is rougher around the edges than more established parts of oVirt, but once you get it up and running, it’s worth the trouble.</p>
