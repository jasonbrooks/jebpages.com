title: Running oVirt's Guest Agent on Atomic as a Privileged Container

<blockquote>Atomic hosts are meant to be as slim as possible, with a bare minimum of applications and services built-in, and everything else running in containers. However, what counts as your bare minimum is sure to differ from mine, particularly when we’re running our Atomic hosts in different environments.</p>
<p>For instance, I’m frequently testing and using Atomic hosts on my oVirt installation, where it’s handy to have oVirt’s guest agent running, which provides handy information about what’s going on inside of an oVirt-hosted VM. If you aren’t using oVirt, though, there’s no reason to carry this package around in what’s supposed to be a svelte image.</p></blockquote>
