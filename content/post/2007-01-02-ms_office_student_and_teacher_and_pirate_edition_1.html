<p>Over at <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com">Microsoft Watch</a>, our own Joe Wilcox has penned <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/business_applications/a_lesson_in_office_student_and_teacher_edition.html">an interesting post</a> about how popular Microsoft Office Student and Teacher Edition has become in comparison to Microsoft's more costly business editions of Office.</p>
<p>
In particular, his last paragraph caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>OneNote could greatly diminish the value for business users looking for activational copies of Office on the cheap. Businesses would more likely want Outlook. I'd argue the Outlook-for-OneNote swap is as much about discouraging piracy as offering something possibly more suited to consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Joe said it, not Microsoft, but I do wonder whether Microsoft actually considers the purchase of STE by non-qualified persons to be an act of piracy.</p>
<p>
Also, I don't know if activational is a word, but I'll allow it.&nbsp; After all, ours is a living language...</p></p>
