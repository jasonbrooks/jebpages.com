  If you are a command line guru, you call upon your zypper, yum, conary, or apt-get from the terminal, and you awk sed grep your way to what you're after.

  For me, unless I know exactly what package I want--and I often don't...

<p>
If you are a command line guru, you call upon your <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Zypper/Usage#General_Usage">zypper</a>, <a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/en/sn-managing-packages.html">yum</a>, <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary:QuickReference">conary</a> or <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto#head-a3cd20763cc57204b80be5ae3f3cbaa825e648a0">apt-get</a> from the terminal, and you awk sed grep your way to what you're after.</p>
<p>
For me, unless I know exactly what package I want--and I often don't--I typically turn to <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/action.html">Synaptic</a>, the graphical package manager that graces my Ubuntu notebook. Synaptic is a really nice application, and I've spent untold hours nerdily sifting through the massive software catalog that Ubuntu inherits from Debian.</p>
<p>
There are six packages in the repositories that match a search for "Software Defined Radio." They hail from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/doc/exploring-gnuradio.html#intro">GNU Radio project</a>, and it pleases me to know that when I finally get around to playing with SDR and GNU Radio, they're waiting just a few clicks away.</p>
<p>
I've also used Synaptic to resolve <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/34650">unasked questions</a>, like when I tried to <a href="http://blogs.eweek.com/brooks/content/open_source/java_joins_gpl_family.html">gauge the health</a> of the java-gnome bindings project by searching for packages with a java-gnome dependency.</p>
<p>
Like I said, nerdily.</p>
<p>
I've <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Desktop-Linux-Trio-Offers-Look-at-Whats-To-Come/">mentioned favorably</a> Ubuntu's simpler Add/Remove Applications tool in reviews before, but I don't usually use it myself, since I think of myself as a Power User.</p>
<p>
It turns out, though, that the simpler tool launches faster and searches faster, too. I needed a color picker to help me come up with a color hex with which to customize a Web application. Just after I kicked off a search for "color picker" in Synaptic, I flipped over to the Add/Remove program, typed in the same search and still beat good old Synaptic.</p>
<p>
So even us Power Users (circa Windows 2000) can learn to benefit from simpler tools--at least some of the time.</p>
<p>
And happily, during the brief link hunt that I carried out to come up with the apt-get et al howto links from the first paragraph, I learned a couple new terminal tricks. I guess I'm off to play with apt-cache policy now, and inch imperceptibly toward command line gurudom. Nerdily.</p>
