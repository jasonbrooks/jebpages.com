<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-137" title="My Red Hat" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hat.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="250" />Last month, I started work at Red Hat--a big career shift after spending 12 years in tech journalism in the Labs department at eWEEK magazine.</p>
<p>Turning in one's press badge for a set of company credentials is a bit like embracing The Dark Side. I do love a good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)">heel turn</a>, but I must say that working for a company that <a href="http://opensource.com/open-source-way">gives away</a> what it produces dissolves some of that drama and robs me of figurative steel chair shot opportunities.</p>
<p>I'm part of a new team at Red Hat <span style="color:#333333;font-style:normal;line-height:24px;">charged with helping the various open source projects and standards efforts with which Red Hat is involved be wildly successful. </span>We're sort of a roving band of open source contributors within the company, working both with well-established projects like Fedora and JBoss.org, and with new projects like <a href="http://www.ovirt.org">oVirt</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be blogging here about the projects I'm working with, and about various other items of interest (to me).</p>
