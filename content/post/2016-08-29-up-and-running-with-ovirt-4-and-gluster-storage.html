title: Up and Running with oVirt 4 and Gluster Storage

<p>In June, the oVirt Project shipped version 4.0 of its open source virtualization management system. With a new release comes an update to this howto for running oVirt together with Gluster storage using a trio of servers to provide for the system's virtualization and storage needs, in a configuration that allows you to take one of the three hosts down at a time without disrupting your running VMs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest new elements in this version of the howto is the introduction of gdeploy, an Ansible based deployment tool that was initially written to install GlusterFS clusters, but that's grown to take on a bunch of complementary tasks. For this process, it'll save us a bunch of typing and speed things up significantly.</p>
