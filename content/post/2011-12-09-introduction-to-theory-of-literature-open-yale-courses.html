<p>I started in on this course, via podcast, today during my bus ride.</p>
<blockquote><p>Introduction to Theory of Literature with Professor Paul H. Fry</p>
<p>About the Course</p>
<p>This is a survey of the main trends in twentieth-century literary theory. Lectures will provide background for the readings and explicate them where appropriate, while attempting to develop a coherent overall context that incorporates philosophical and social perspectives on the recurrent questions: what is literature, how is it produced, how can it be understood, and what is its purpose? view class sessions &gt;&gt;</p>
