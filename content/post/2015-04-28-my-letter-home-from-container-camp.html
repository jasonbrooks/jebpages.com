<blockquote>Just over a week ago, I headed to the outskirts of San Francisco’s Financial District to attend Container Camp, a one-day, single-track conference focused primarily on the Docker ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Container Camp lineup included a nice mix of project talks and real user stories that left me looking forward to attending the next time the crew comes to town, and thinking back on the key issues raised during the event.</p></blockquote>
