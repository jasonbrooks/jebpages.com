  Apple's subnotebook wunder-machine is nigh. I've been waiting for an ultralight Web and writing machine for a long time now. So, should I run out and pant outside my local Apple store until the first units arrive?

Apple's <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/Introducing-Apples-MacBook-Air/">subnotebook wunder-machine</a> is nigh. I've <a href="http://blogs.eweek.com/brooks/content/apple/crossing_my_fingers_for_an_insanely_great_macworld_2008.html">been waiting</a> for an ultralight Web and writing machine <a href="http://blogs.eweek.com/brooks/content/will_palms_foleo_fulfill_its_promises.html">for a long time now</a>. So, should I run out and pant outside my local Apple store until the first units arrive?</p>
<p>
Based on the information available right now, let's weigh the pros and cons ...</p>
<p>
<strong>Pros: </strong></p>
<p>
The Macbook Air is slim and light.</p>
<p>
The unit's multitouch-equipped touch pad looks interesting, but I'd have to try it out for myself to gauge its worth.</p>
<p>
The Macbook Air offers up to 5 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>
Limited connectivity. There's only one USB port, and USB hubs never seem to work as well as built-in ports do. There's no Ethernet adapter, either.</p>
<p>
Disposable? The battery is apparently not user-replaceable, nor is RAM, nor is the hard drive. It's one thing to sell a disposable $300 mobile device, it's quite another to sell a disposable $1,800 to $3,000 notebook. Who among us has never swapped a notebook battery, or upgraded our RAM?</p>
<p>
Five hours of battery life sounds great, but I assume that's for a Macbook Air outfitted with a solid-state drive, which adds $1,000 to the cost of the unit. I'd rather pay less for a device with much less storage. I can keep more data up in the AIR, right?</p>
<p>
<strong>My Snap Judgment (subject to change):</strong></p>
<p>
If my checkbook were fat enough, I'd probably preorder the Macbook Air immediately. Of course, in the land of "ifs," I'd probably also buy myself a whole branch of Fry's Electronics to use as a personal playground of gadgetry and wires.</p>
<p>
However, as things currently stand, I'll probably wait for a few generations of Macbook Air notebooks to pass by (along with several friendly price drops) before I'd pick up one of these very slick-looking machines.</p>
<p>
How does the Macbook Air strike you?</p>
