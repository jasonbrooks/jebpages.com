  Brian Prince is reporting today that Google is considering enforcing SSL encryption by default for its Google Apps users. It's a good idea--as eWEEK Labs' own Andrew Garcia discussed recently, your on-the-go applications can have an awful lot to say about you.

  In fact, enforcing HTTPS encryption for Google Apps by default is such a good idea that you shouldn't wait for Google to implement it. Whether you administer a Google Apps domain or are an individual user of the service, you should enable the mandatory SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption yourself, right now.

  Here's how you do it:

<p>Brian Prince is reporting today that <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Google-Considers-Tightening-Gmail-Security-222281/">Google is considering enforcing SSL encryption by default</a> for its Google Apps users. It's a good idea--as eWEEK Labs' own <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Is-Mobile-Security-an-Oxymoron-196209/">Andrew Garcia discussed</a> recently, your on-the-go applications can have an awful lot to say about you.</p>

In fact, enforcing HTTPS encryption for Google Apps by default is such a good idea that you shouldn't wait for Google to implement it. Whether you administer a Google Apps domain or are an individual user of the service, you should enable the mandatory SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption yourself, right now.</p>
<p>
Here's how you do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step One: Visit https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/YOURDOMAINHERE and log in.</li>
<li>Step Two: Click "Domain settings" in the menu bar across the top of the screen.</li>
<li>Step Three: Check the box marked "Enable SSL."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Step Four: Click the "Save changes" button.</li>
<li>Step Five: Take a look at the General Settings page within one of your managed Gmail accounts, and confirm that your users have no choice but to connect via SSL.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display:inline;"><img alt="gmailssl2.png" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gmailssl2.png" width="400" height="244" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>
<p>
If you're a regular Gmail user, or if you have a Google Apps account without an established SSL connection policy, you can use this same settings page radio button to upgrade Gmail security on your own.</p>
<p /></p></p>
