<p>In general, I prefer Google+ to Twitter. I like posting more than 140 characters, and I like editing my posts if I need/want to (there are other things I like about G+, but this test post is about those first two). I noticed, recently, how people who post wp.me links onto Twitter get their posts, or a portion of their posts, attached to the tweet behind a little photo-style view media link. I'm messing with that right now.</p>

<p>I should say, though, that I've been feeling increasingly grumbly about Google+ and its RW API-lessness, and I do like Twitter nonetheless, and, uh, yeah.</p>
