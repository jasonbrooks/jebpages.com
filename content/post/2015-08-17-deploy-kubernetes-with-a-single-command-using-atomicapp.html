<blockquote>Kubernetes, the open source orchestration system for Docker containers, is a fast-moving project that can be somewhat complicated to install and configure, especially if you’re just getting started with it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the project maintains some really well-done getting started guides, the simplest of which steps you through running Kubernetes, in Docker containers, on a single host. </p></blockquote>
