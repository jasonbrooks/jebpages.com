excerpt: HP has announced plans to acquire thin-client vendor Neoware--a smart move,
  since endpoint security problems remain a major problem for enterprises, and thin
  clients offer one of the best solutions for limiting this exposure.

<p>As my <a href="http://linuxdevices.com" target="_blank">LinuxDevices.com</a> colleague Henry Kingman <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS6008434061.html" target="_blank">reported this morning,</a> Hewlett-Packard has announced plans to acquire thin-client vendor Neoware.</p>
<p>This looks like a smart move for HP. Endpoint security problems, including lost, stolen or otherwise subverted client systems, remain a major problem for enterprises, and thin clients offer one of the best solutions for limiting client exposure.</p>
<p>Neoware's m100 thin-client notebook, in particular, has caught my eye, as it seems to deliver the sort of light weight, long battery life and smart network-resource leveraging I've been looking for.</p>
<p>What's more, I'm looking forward to seeing where HP takes Neoware's Linux-based product lines. Neoware's Linux-powered thin clients offer connectivity to Microsoft's Terminal Services, but Version 1.5 of the Linux-compatible RDesktop RDP client currently lacks support for RDP 6, the version of the protocol to which Vista and Windows Server 2008 now default.</p>
<p>HP could get off to a good start with its Neoware stewardship by stepping forward to provide technical and monetary resources to the RDesktop project to bring RDP 6 support to Linux.</p></p></p>
