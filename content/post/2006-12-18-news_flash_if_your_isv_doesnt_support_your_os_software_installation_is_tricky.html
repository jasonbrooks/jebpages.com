title: 'News Flash: If Your ISV Doesn''t Support Your OS, Software Installation is
  Tricky'

<p>Ian Murdock, the founder (and second syllable) of the Linux operating system Debian, <a href="http://ianmurdock.com/?p=388">is sounding off</a> about his displeasure with software installation on Linux.</p>
<p>For instance, he cites the install procedure for Sun's Java Studio Creator.&nbsp; On Windows, you double click the exe. On Linux, make the install script executable, run it to extract an RPM, and install that RPM--if, of course, your Linux distro supports RPM, which many, such as Ubuntu Linux, do not.</p>
<p>The trouble of course is that while supporting Windows means supporting one OS, supporting Linux means supporting a potentially unlimited number of OSes built atop the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>The answer?&nbsp; Ask your ISV to support your Linux OS properly, preferably by making available a network repository with binaries packaged for your particular OS.&nbsp; If enough other customers use the same OS as you, maybe it'll work.</p>
<p>For a cleaner, broader, easier answer, I'm looking forward to reading Murdock's followup post, which he's said will be a summary of the goings-on at the Linux Standard Base group's recent <a href="http://www.freestandards.org/en/LSB_face-to-face_%28December_2006%29">software packaging summit</a>.</p>
