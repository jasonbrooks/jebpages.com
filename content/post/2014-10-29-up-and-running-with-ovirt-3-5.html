<blockquote>Last week, version 3.5 of oVirt, the open source virtualization management system, hit FTP mirrors sporting a slate of fixes and enhancements, including a new-look user interface, and support for using CentOS 7 machines as virtualization hosts.</p>
<p>As with every new oVirt release, I'm here to suggest a path to getting up and running with the project on single server, with an option for expanding to additional machines in the future.</p></blockquote>
