<p>As a speedy, modern, cross-platform Web browser, Firefox 4 is well worth evaluating for <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Web-Services-Web-20-and-SOA/Mozilla-Firefox-4-Boasts-Performance-and-Usability-Enhancements-188806/"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-41" title="firefox401" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/firefox401-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>any organization, particularly those with a heterogeneous mix of client operating systems. On this multiplatform front, however, organizations should also keep an eye on Google's Chrome, which tends to match Firefox in features and performance, and offers Group Policy-based management support that Firefox 4 lacks. For those already running earlier versions of Firefox, version 4 will be well worth the upgradeâ€”provided that any add-ons on which users rely are compatible with the new version.</p>
