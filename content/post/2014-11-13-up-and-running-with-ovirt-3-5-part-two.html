<blockquote>Two weeks ago in this space, I wrote about how to deploy the virtualization, storage, and management elements of the new oVirt 3.5 release on a single machine. Today, we're going to add two more machines to the mix, which will enable us to bring down one machine at a time for maintenance while allowing the rest of the deployment to continue its virtual machine hosting duties uninterrupted.</p></blockquote>
