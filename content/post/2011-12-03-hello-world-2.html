<p>I read that Red Hat's OpenShift now supports <a href="https://www.redhat.com/openshift/blogs/jenkins-and-more-new-openshift-release-nov-15-2011">custom domain names</a>, so I thought I'd give the service's <a href="https://github.com/openshift/wordpress-example">Wordpress Example</a> a go. Getting my blog set up here was crazily simple to do...</p>
