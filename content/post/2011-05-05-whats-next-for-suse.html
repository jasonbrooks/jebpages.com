<p>Late last month, The Attachmate Group <a href="http://www.attachmate.com/Press/PressReleases/attachmate-group-completes-aquisition-of-novell.htm">completed its acquisition</a> of Novell. Moving forward, Novell and SUSE Linux will operate, alongside NetIQ and Attachmate, as four separate business units—a reorganization that unravels the 2003 SUSE acquisition that had established Novell as a Linux and open source player.</p>
<p>In the years following its SUSE pickup, Novell trumpeted its new, open source direction so loudly that it's tough to imagine exactly what a SUSE-free Novell will look like moving forward.<!--more--></p>
<p>Between its <a title="SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Gets SP1 Flexibility" href="http://eweeklabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/suse1.jpgarchives/suse-linux-enterprise-server-11-gets-sp1-flexibility-3">SUSE Linux Enterprise</a> operating system, its patent and collaboration deals with Microsoft, and its open source implementation of .NET, Mono, Novell had built a solid story for itself as a sane middle path between Microsoft and Linux-centric technology approaches.</p>
<p>Now, after having situated SUSE at the core of its product line—dumping, for instance, the aging Netware OS for the SUSE-based Open Enterprise Server—Novell has to figure out where it fits in today's IT landscape.</p>
<p>Conversely, the future seems brighter for SUSE, which <a title="Give Novell a Break" href="http://eweeklabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/suse1.jpgarchives/give_novell_a_break">took a lot of heat</a> in the open source community for its associations with Microsoft, but, which, on balance, came out ahead during its time with Novell by picking up more enterprise clout.</p>
<p>As for figuring out its place in the IT landscape, my recent <a title="Novell SUSE Manager 1.2 Taps Red Hat Technology to Rein In Enterprise Linux" href="http://eweeklabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/suse1.jpgarchives/novell-suse-manager-1-2-taps-red-hat-technology-to-rein-in-enterprise-linux">review of SUSE Manager</a> indicates the sort of opportunities available. The SUSE Manager product is based on Red Hat's own, open sourced, management product, Satellite. Where Red Hat's Satellite supports only <a title="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Handles Workloads Physical and Virtual" href="http://eweeklabs.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/suse1.jpgarchives/red-hat-enterprise-linux-6-handles-workloads-physical-and-virtual-3">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, SUSE Manager embraces SUSE Linux as well as RHEL.</p>
<p>When the number one vendor in your field makes a point of releasing its works under an open source license, it's not too bad being number two. Although Red Hat is growing at a steady clip, there are more enterprise open source opportunities out there than Red Hat alone can seize.</p>
<p>In the months ahead, I'll be interested to see just how aggressively a SUSE unburdened from Novell's legacy product lines takes advantage of its number two spot by adjusting its own products to better draft on the Linux leader.</p>
