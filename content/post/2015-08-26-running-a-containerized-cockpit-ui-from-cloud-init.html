<blockquote>Fedora 22’s Atomic Host dropped most of packages for the web-based server UI, cockpit, from its system tree in favor of a containerized deployment approach. Matt Micene blogged about running cockpit-in-a-container with systemd, but people have expressed interest in learning how to start this container automatically, with cloud-init.</p></blockquote>
