Today my colleague Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols is reporting on Mandriva founder Gael Duval's Ulteo, which now offers online access to the OpenOffice.org productivity suite:</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="OpenOffice.org goes online with SAAS version" href="http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS8962292831.html">OpenOffice.org goes online with SAAS version</a></p></blockquote>
<p>
I'm an OpenOffice.org user and overall fan of software as a service--particularly when it's a free service--so I thought I'd take Ulteo for a spin.</p>
<p>

<p>
<i>Trouble was, I could tell how to upload my spreadsheet to Ulteo. The grayed-out box seemed to be the source of the trouble. A Java applet that failed to load, perhaps?</i></p>

<p>
<i>I consulted Ulteo's search for help, but there were zero non-advertisement results for the term "upload documents."</i></p>

<p>
<i>I read in SJVN's story that I needed the "real" Java runtime from Sun to use Ulteo. As far as I could tell, that's what I was using ...</i></p>
