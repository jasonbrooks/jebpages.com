<p>Having reached a good break point in <a title="Fedora 17, OpenStack Essex &amp; Gluster 3.3: All Smushed Together" href="http://blog.jebpages.com/archives/fedora-17-openstack-and-gluster-3-3/">my Gluster/Openstack/Fedora tests</a>, I thought I'd <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_PreUpgrade">preupgrade</a> the F16 VM I've been using for ovirt engine to F17, en route to the oVirt 3.1 beta.</p>
<p>That didn't go so well.Â During the post-preupgrade part (uh, the upgrade), the installer balked at upgrading the jboss-as package that shipped with oVirt 3.0. Afterward, the VM wouldn't boot correctly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was prepared for failure, detaching my iso domain in advance, and shuttling the templates and VMs I wanted to keep to the export domain, which I also detached.</p>
