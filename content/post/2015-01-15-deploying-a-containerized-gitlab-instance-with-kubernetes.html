title: Deploying a Containerized Gitlab Instance with Kubernetes

<blockquote>Back in November, I wrote about how to try out Kubernetes, the open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, using Atomic Hosts. In that post, I walked through a deployment of the Kubernetes project’s multicontainer "Hello World" application.</p>
<p>This time, I thought I’d explore running a more real-world application on Kubernetes, while looking into a few alternate methods of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>For the application, I picked Gitlab, an open source code collaboration platform that resembles and works like the popular Github service. I run a Gitlab instance internally here at work, and I wanted to explore moving that application from its current, virtual machine-based home, toward a shiny new containerized future.</p></blockquote>
