<p>
Today at its Lotusphere 2011 event in Orlando, IBM announced tech preview of <a href="https://www.lotuslive.com/en/symphony">LotusLive Symphony</a>, a Web-based office app duo to extend its Lotus Symphony productivity suite. I <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Lotus-Symphony-30-Vies-to-Eclipse-OpenOfficeorg-as-Microsoft-Office-Challenger-263571/">reviewed the desktop-bound edition of Symphony</a> a few months back, and Andrew Garcia took on the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/250820/">LotusLive online collaboration service</a>.</p>
<p>
It's interesting to see IBM add a Web app component to Symphony, much as Microsoft has done with its own <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Microsoft-Office-2010-Boosts-Core-Features-Branches-Out-onto-the-Web-821064/">Office 2010 and Office Web Apps offerings</a>. I tend to use a combination of Web and desktop-native apps in my daily work--both platforms offer certain advantages, so why not take advantage of both?</p>
<p>
After spending about 20 minutes of wandering within LotusLive Symphony--a few minutes of which I've embedded for your viewing below--it seems that IBM's new Web apps, which include word processing and spreadsheet components, are off to a decent enough start.</p>
<p>
I tried the new Web-based Symphony out with one of Microsoft's Word-formatted reviewer guides--these tend to be heavily formatted, so they offer a decent test of applications' Office-format fidelity chops. I found various small formatting issues, which is the standard I've come to expect. One feature that caught my eye was a task assignment capability I've not seen in competing Web-based products.</p>
<p>
What's your take on Web-based versions of existing desktop apps? Me-too feature of the new decade, wise embrace of the Web, or something else?</p>
