title: Clustering Atomic Hosts with Kubernetes, Ansible, & Vagrant

<blockquote>
  A single Atomic Host is a fine place to run your containers, but these hosts are much more fun when bunched into clusters, a task that we can manage with the help of Kubernetes.</p>
<p>  There are a lot of great guides for setting up a kubernetes cluster, but my favorite involves ansible and vagrant, and lives in the kubernetes contrib repository on Github.</p>
<p>  This install method can be used with the libvirt, virtualbox or openstack vagrant providers. You can also use the ansible scripts on their own, if vagrant isnâ€™t your thing.
