Back around the turn of the millennium, I had the great fortune of watching the Windows XP, aka Whistler, development cycle unfold. I had so much fun tracking the procession of development releases topped by the shiny gold master copy of <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/XP-Sends-9X-Packing/">Windows XP</a>, that I sought after, and found, an operating system to track that was in perpetual development: Linux!</p>
<p>
Over at eWEEK's main site, I've compiled a short <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Linux-Distribution-Releases-to-Watch-in-2011-383910/">gallery of Linux distribution releases set for the first half of 2011</a> that have caught my eye. Check out the gallery for a peek at the releases and for what it is in each that's gotten my attention, or simply consult the list below, and let me know which ones I'm missing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ubuntu 11.04: Natty Narwhal :: Expected release date: 2011-04-28.</li>
<li>Fedora 15 :: Expected release date: 2011-05-10.</li>
<li>OpenSUSE 11.4 :: Expected release date: 2011-05-10.</li>
<li>CentOS 6 :: Expected release: imminent.</li>
<li>Debian Squeeze :: Expected release date: 2011-02-06.</li>
<li>ChromeOS :: Expected release date: mid-2011.</li>

</ol></p>
