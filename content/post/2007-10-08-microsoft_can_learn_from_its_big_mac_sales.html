  My Microsoft Watch colleague Joe Wilcox  is reporting today on some rather eye-catching Apple/Microsoft numbers:

  "Here's a big number: 20 percent of Microsoft Office's U.S retail sales are the Mac version, according to NPD. Here's another: Mac users account for 10 percent of retail Windows Vista Business and Ultimate sales."

  If OS X, with its estimated 5 percent market share, can account for 20 percent of Office's retail sales, and if a significant share of Vista purchases are going to users who wish to run the OS simply as a virtualized application layer, it's worth asking how many dollars Microsoft is leaving on the table by limiting its cross-platform efforts.

My Microsoft Watch colleague Joe Wilcox <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/business_applications/microsofts_big_mac_sales.html"> is reporting today</a> on some rather eye-catching Apple/Microsoft numbers:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
"Here's a big number: 20 percent of Microsoft Office's U.S retail sales are the Mac version, according to NPD. Here's another: Mac users account for 10 percent of retail Windows Vista Business and Ultimate sales."</p></blockquote>
<p>
It doesn't surprise me that Office for the Mac sells well. There aren't many alternatives to Office for OS X&#8212;Apple's recently rounded-out iWork '08 is still rather young, and OpenOffice.org doesn't yet fit as neatly with OS X as it does with Linux or Windows.</p>
<p>
What's more, like the rest of us, Mac users live in a thoroughly Microsoft-dominated computing environment, so picking up a copy of Office along with your shiny new Mac probably strikes switchers as a safe bet.</p>
<p>
What I find more interesting is the volume of Windows Vista buyers who appear to be picking up a copy of Windows to run under <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2167602,00.asp">VMware Fusion</a> or Parallels Workstation for sort of a mega-lifeline to Windows.</p>
<p>
In his post, Joe asks whether it's smart for Microsoft to aid Apple's cause by continuing to build software for OS X. I contend that Microsoft would be better off if it did just the opposite&#8212;start worrying less about owning users' computing environments and start focusing on selling people what they want on the platforms of their choice.</p>
<p>
If OS X, with its estimated 5 percent market share, can account for 20 percent of Office's retail sales, and if a significant share of Vista purchases are going to users who wish to run the OS simply as a virtualized application layer, it's worth asking how many dollars Microsoft is leaving on the table by limiting its cross-platform efforts.</p>
<p>
I know that I've been enticed at times by Microsoft Office, just not enough to quit using Linux on my home and work systems. For instance, when Office 2003 came out, I was <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1495279,00.asp">enamored with Infopath</a>, but I couldn't get past the application's platform limitations.</p>
<p>
As a result, I more or less forgot about Infopath, and today, people are wondering why <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/philoj/archive/2007/02/25/why-hasn-t-anyone-heard-of-infopath.aspx">no one's heard</a> of the application.</p>
<p /></p></p></p></p>
