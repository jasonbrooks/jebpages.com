<blockquote>When compared to dynamic sites based on WordPress or Drupal, staticly generated blog and Web sites (like this one) can go a long way toward simplifying deployment and maintenance. There’s no database or server-side code to maintain, and, when paired with a service like Github or Gitlab, you can accept posts or other contributions from anyone, via pull request.</p>
<p>However, while simplifying certain areas, static sites introduce a bit more complexity in other areas. Among the handful of Middleman-based static sites that our team at Red Hat help maintain, we’ve seen the specter of “it works on my laptop” arise. </p></blockquote>
