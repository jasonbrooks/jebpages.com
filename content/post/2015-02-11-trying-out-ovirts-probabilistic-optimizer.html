title: Trying out oVirt's Probabilistic Optimizer

<blockquote>Next week in Los Angeles, I'll be giving a talk at the SCALE 13x conference on oVirt's new OptaPlanner-powered scheduling adviser.</p>
<p>Martin Sivák wrote a great post about the feature a couple of months ago, but didn't cover its installation process, which still has a few rough edges.</p>
<p>Read on to learn how to install the optimizer, and start applying fancy probabilistic fu to your oVirt VM launches and migrations.</p></blockquote>
