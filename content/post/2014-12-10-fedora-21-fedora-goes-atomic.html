<blockquote>This week, Fedora 21 (a.k.a., the release that must not be named) hit FTPs mirrors everywhere, with a feature list led by a new organizational structure for the distribution. Fedora is now organized into three separate flavors: Workstation, Server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>Fedora's Cloud flavor is further divided into a "traditional" base image for deploying the distribution on your cloud of choice, and an Atomic Host image into which Fedora's team of cloud wranglers has herded a whole series of futuristic operating system technologies.</p></blockquote>
