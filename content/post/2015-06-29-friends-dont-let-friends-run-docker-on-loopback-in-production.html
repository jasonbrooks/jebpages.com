<blockquote>I’ve heard negative things about the Fedora|CentOS Docker storage configuration in the past, and while manning the Red Hat booth in San Francisco at DockerCon last week, I spoke to a number of people who’ve experienced these storage issues themselves.</p>
<p>Much of the trouble, I think, boils down to how Docker in Fedora and CentOS have shipped with a storage configuration that optimizes for a convenient getting started experience that can lead to inconvenience down the road. </p></blockquote>
