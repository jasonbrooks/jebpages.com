<blockquote>The oVirt Project is now putting the finishing touches on version 3.3 of its KVM-based virtualization management platform. The release will be feature-packed, including expanded support for Gluster storage, new integration points for OpenStack’s Neutron networking and Glance image services, and a raft of new extensibility and usability upgrades.</p>
<p>oVirt 3.3 also sports an overhauled All-in-One (AIO) setup plugin, which makes it easy to get up and running with oVirt on a single machine to see what oVirt can do for you.</p></blockquote>
